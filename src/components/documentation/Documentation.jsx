          <strong> A product management system</strong> is a web application that allows us to
          manage products and Categories . It includes login and register
          functionality that can help us to secure access to sensitive data and
          control who has access to the system and only the registered users
          will have the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and
          Delete ) operations.
